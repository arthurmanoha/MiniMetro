Passenger dialogue is only heard at close zoom level.

Tools:

Display a list radio buttons for locomotives in a panel; a selected radio button will focus the view on the loco.
Focus from static view to loco view shall be smoothed.
Focus on a full train, a loco and everything linked to it.
Display the current speed of each loco if a radio button is checked.

Create passengers with destination.

High-Speed trains:
Can drive faster than other trains.
Only high-speed tracks accept certain speeds; the higher the speed (above the limit), the greater probability that the track fails.
Trains leave track and crash if turns are taken at an excessive speed.

Tracks wear off with time and use, and need to be replaced.
Tracks wear off quicker when trains drive faster.
High-speed tracks are more expensive per unit length.
Passengers pay money when they get to their destination.

When the user requests a track be created outside the world bounds, the world must be extended one row or column.

A StationCell may not host a switch.
A Switch may no longer be deleted if it hosts a train.
Fixed: An AIOOB exception occurs when a train leaves a track cell where a switch was deleted.
Fixed: Exception raised when the file specified by config.txt does not exist.
Fixed using a Swing timer and cell indices: Simulation gets very slow when 8-10 or more links between TrainElements are used.
Chunks are replaced with a fixed-size array.
Only modified or populated cells shall be written to file.
Altitude for cells with a negative row or column is incorrect.
Chunks shall be loaded via a click using the "chunk" tool.

The Remove Tracks tool shall allow to remove switches.
Fixed: Switch Cells now save their TrainElements.
Switches are saved to and loaded from file.
TrainElements shall follow the tracks defined by switches.
Added switches - in progress
Simulate only cells that have trains or passengers.
Fixed: A large amount of tracks, even without a train, will slow the game down. Fixed by simulating only active cells.
